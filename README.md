# MOONSHOT
honestly this project is a mess because moondream determines that every screenshot is " ".
i ask for 3 words and it gives me a thesis on the socio-economic impact of pixels, or nothing at all.
instructions:
1. install ollama
2. run this script 
3. watch it fail to name files correctly
dependencies:
- watchdog 
- ollama (the source of my pain)
maybe use llava instead. idk. i'm done.
